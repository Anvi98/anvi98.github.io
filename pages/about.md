<p style="text-align: justify;">
Just a passionate of learning. I do a lot of experiments and reflects on them either on AI or other stuffs that you will be able to see in this blog. I don't walk with the trends I rather question it and go reverse if necessary. You will enjoy some articles here if you are looking for deep insights.
